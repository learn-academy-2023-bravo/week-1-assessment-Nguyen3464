# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: A conditional statment is a way to make decisions by controling the flow of outcome based off of evaluations of imput.  

Researched answer: Conditional statments use if/else statments and the evaluations check boolean true or false values.  The comparison of condtions can be made using equality, logical, and relational operations.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a version control software that allows developers to manage files, work flow, and documentation of repositories on local computers.  It also allows for independent contributions to be made to workspaces and projects that can be compiled to an online directory.

GitHub is the remote or online terminal or nexus where repositiories of multi faceted projects are dispached, retrieved, compiled and managed from.  The files live on a cloud which can be acceess remotly and imported locally to individual computers.

Researched answer: Git is an opensource DevOps tool that allows for remote management and tracking of source code.  It allows for non linear contributions to be made by multiple developers.  

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control of files and colaboration of work between multiple contributor can centrally located.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: Equality, Logical, Relational operators will all return an evaluation of a boolean data type.

Researched answer: the ! or bang boolean operator is evaluating if condition is the opposite of what is being compared.  It is not returning the direct true or false boolean logical value of the condition being evaluated.


3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: Index is the position of character of a String data type. When looking at Arrays it is the postion of the element within the array.  Counting index position's within Strings and Arrays always starts with position 0.  Value of a string is defined as the characters of a string, and in an array the values are the indivudal elements data types.

Researched answer: Strings are ordered sequences of character data. Indexing allows you to access individual characters in a string. A string value is just a sequence of characters such as letters, numbers. A string value uses quotes syntax. 
An array is a structure that contains an ordered collection of data types, within this context they are called elements.  each element can be referenced by its index value in the array. 

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Similarities: You can refrence the length of a string and array.  When accessing the of characters, an index value is used to log the position.  Both can be used to describe an content of its subject. Strings are used to discribe the subject, while arrays can contain its subject as diffrent forms of data types.
Diffrences: strings 

Researched answer: Arrays siz are fixed base on the content when assigned. When assigining a string the character size can vary.  Both strings and arrays can be manipulated or accessed through its properties and built in method.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programing involves contributions of two developers.  While one is manipulating the code and making changes based of calls the navigator is making. They control and maintain the active workspace. This developer is in the role as Driver.  The Navigator's contribution is the overviewer.  They contribute through adding input of ideads, brainstorm, syntax and grammer correctioss.  The nagivator is not activly engaged with the keyboard, because of this reserve role they are afforded more room to focus on the big picture.  It is important for both developers to perform in both of these roles to understand the perspective of hands on, actively engaged, and reserve overview.  Big picture, Little picture.  This wholeistic approach better insures complete best practice execution is 
attaianed when developing.

Researched answer: While this approach may lengthing the imput of hours to compete a job, the method insures are more robust, clean, and percise product.  This also mitigates potential bugs, and errors made because there are less instances of merging code.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher Order Function is like daisy chaining fuctions.  You can use nesting, is when you have a function that takes another function as a parameter.  Or when your function returns another function thus allowing for complex, condensed, and streamline forms of mutating data.

2. Jest: Jest is a opensource testing framework designed to ensure proper utilization of Javascript.  A common usecase is the React framework that Javascript is apart of. This allows developers to write tests to check javascript's codebase integrity.

3. Objects: Objects is a data type that has a collection of properties.  These properties are represented as KEY : Value pairs.  Objects can store diffrent data types as values.  Values can also be represented as a function.  This is known as a method.

4. Method: Methods are either accessors or mutators.  This behavior can me preform on objects.  These actions are properties containing a function, the property holds the function definition.  Some examples are console.log(), the .log is a method that calls a function.  When making a function, in order to invoke the function a developer must call the function after the function is declared.  functionName();

5. Classes: Classes are templates for creating, and changing objects.  Properties, key: value pairs can be added, removed or changed and classes help access and mutate these characteristics and values of objects.
